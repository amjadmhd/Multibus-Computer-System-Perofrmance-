# Multibus-Computer-System-Perofrmance
An example of using SHARPE to evaluate computer system perofrmance.

Based on the model provided in: Marsan, M. A., & Gerla, M. (1982). Markov models for multiple bus multiprocessor systems. IEEE Transactions on Computers, (3), 239-248.

In this example we consider a system with 4 processors, 4 common memories and 2 buses:
* Processors execute on there own private cache and then perform some operations on a common memory.
* The rate of requesting common memories is exponentially distrbuted and defined as (Lambda)
* The processor selects a common memory randomly with equal probaility 1/4
*
